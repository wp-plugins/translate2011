translate 1.3 (15. June 2011)
	
	June 2011; Jaroslav Rakhmatoullin <jazzoslav@gmail.com>:
	* The meta_key which is used for translating titles is no longer just
	the language name. For clarity there is now an underscore folowed by
	`title' like so: 
		meta_key: english -> english_title

	* updated the admin page.
		 - removing and making languages default works.
		 - added a dictionary and forms to manipulate it.

	* removed the old wp_translate table. The new table names are now 
	prefix_translate_langs and prefix_translate_dict. _langs table has new 
	fields: icon and order which deside which img to show for language in 
	list_translations() as well as the order of languages.



	

translate 1.2 (2007)
	* Translate no longer uses commas as delimiters for the parameters, use the 
	| pipe symbol instead. This caused problems when trying to translate 
	paragraphs with commas.
	* Nested shortcodes. You can now add contact forms, photo galleries and 
	whatever other plugin that uses shortcodes into the [translate] tags.
